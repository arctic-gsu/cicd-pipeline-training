 # Introduction to CI/CD

## 1. What is CI/CD?

- Continuous Integration (CI): A practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, usually several times a day. Each integration triggers automated builds and tests, ensuring that code changes donâ€™t introduce bugs.
- Continuous Deployment (CD): Extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to production environments after passing all tests, ensuring a faster and more reliable delivery pipeline.

## 2. Benefits of CI/CD

- Improved Code Quality: Automated testing detects issues early.
- Faster Delivery: Automating builds, tests, and deployments reduces manual effort.
- Reduced Risk: Smaller, incremental changes are easier to troubleshoot than large releases.
- Increased Collaboration: Encourages teams to integrate and deploy frequently, fostering better communication.

## 3. Key Concepts

- Pipeline: A sequence of automated steps to build, test, and deploy an application.
- Triggers: Events (e.g., code commits, pull requests) that start the pipeline.
- Stages: Phases in the pipeline, such as build, test, and deploy.
- Automation: Using tools like GitHub Actions to eliminate manual steps.
- Runners: Runners are the machines that execute jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow. For example, a runner can clone your repository locally, install testing software, and then run commands that evaluate your code.

## 4. CI/CD Tools Overview

- GitHub Actions: Native CI/CD tool for GitHub repositories.
- ArgoCD: A declarative, GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
